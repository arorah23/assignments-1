	#cat id_rsa.pub (copy the public key and paste it into the auhtorized_keys of user)

2. Add new key to authorized_keys files on your nodes
#go to the nodes and perform following actions
#cd /path to the home directory of user/.ssh
#vim authorized_keys (paste the public key here , copied from above step)

#ssh username@ipaddress

#ansible all -m ping
#ssh-keygen -t rsa
